  /**
   * Processes the supplied async activities and splits them into
   * groups, and operations each representing a file read `fs.readFile`.
   *
   * ## Groups
   *
   * The returned value has a `groups` property which just lists the ids
   * of async resources that were grouped together to form an operation
   * indexed by the id of the `open` resource.
   * Thus the `groups` is a map of sets.
   * If no file read was encountered the groups are empty.
   *
   * ## Operations
   *
   * Additionally an `operations` property is included as well. Each operation
   * represents one full `fs.readFile` execution. There will be one operation per
   * group and they are indexed by the corresponding open resource `id` as well.
   *
   * An `operation` has the following properties:
   *
   * ### `fs.readFile` specific Operation Properties
   *
   *  Data about the async resources that were part of the operation, by default
   *  only `id` and `triggerId` are included:
   *  - **open**: contains data about opening the file
   *  - **stat**: contains data about getting file stats
   *  - **read**: contains data about reading the file
   *  - **close**: contains data about closing the file
   *
   * ### General Operation Properties
   *
   * The information below is the same for all `operation`s and thus is only
   * mentioned here and linked from the documentation of all other processors.
   *
   *  Data about the lifetime of the operation:
   *
   *  - **lifeCycle**: contains three timestamps that detail when an operation was created,
   *    for how long it was alive and when it was destroyed.
   *
   *    - **created**: the timestamp when the first resource of the operation was created
   *    - **destroyed**: the timestamp when the last resource of the operation was destroyed
   *    - **timeAlive**: the difference between the `destroyed` and `created` timestamps, i.e.
   *      how long the operation's resources were alive
   *
   *    Each timestamp has the following two properties provided by [utils.prettyNs](#utilsprettyns).
   *    - **ns**: time in nanoseconds {Number}
   *    - **ms**: pretty printed time in milliseconds {String}
   *
   * Data that links to user code that is responsible for the operation occurring.
   *
   * - **createdAt**: provides the line of code that called `fs.readFile`
   * - **userFunctions**: depending on the settings (see constructor docs) each resource
   *   will include it's own array of userFunctions or they are separated out into
   *   one property with duplicates merged. The latter is the default behavior.
   *   In either case `userFunctions` is an Array of Objects with the following properties:
   *
   *   - **name**: the function name
   *   - **inferredName**: the inferred function name, only needed if the `name` is not set
   *   - **file**: the file in which the function was defined
   *   - **line**: the line on which the functino was defined in that file
   *   - **column**: the column on which the functino was defined in that file
   *   - **location**: the file and line + column where the function was defined combined into a string
   *   - **args**: the `err` and information about the `res` of the operation
   *     with which the function was invoked
   *   - **propertyPaths**: the object paths at which the function was found, these could be multiple
   *     since the function could've been attached to multiple resources (only available if the functions
   *     were separated from the resources and merged)
   *   - **propertyPath**: the object path at which the function was found (only available if the
   *     functions weren't separated and thus are still part of each resource)
   *
   * ## Sample Return Value
   *
   * The sample return value was created with default options.
